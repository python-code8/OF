# OF A subscription based content sharing dapp or basically onlyfans

A recurring income stream for the creators

Creaters can create a account by using createPlan function, enter the token in which you like to get paid, the amount and the frequency
Users can subscribe to a creator by entering their address and view thier posts

In solidity, a function cannot be executed automatically. Someone has to execute the function and pay the gas fee. So when a user subscribes to a creator, his subscription and other details are stored.
So either the user themselves can pay after the subscription expires or the creator can take the money from the user after the subscription expires

If a user cancels the subscription, the creator can no longer take the money by themselves since the record will be deleted
